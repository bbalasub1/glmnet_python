 DESCRIPTION:
    View and/or change the factory default parameters in glmnet. Currently, only
    fdev and big are used in the glmnet libraries. 

 USAGE:
   glmnetControl; (with no input or output arguments)
   displays all inner parameters and their current values.
   glmnetControl(pars);
   sets the internal parameters that appear in the fields of pars to the
   new values. 

 ARGUMENTS:
 pars is a structure with the following fields.
 fdev        minimum fractional change in deviance for stopping path;
             factory default = 1.0e-5.
 devmax      maximum fraction of explained deviance for stopping path;
             factory default = 0.999.
 eps         minimum value of lambda.min.ratio (see glmnet); factory
             default= 1.0e-6.
 big         large floating point number; factory default = 9.9e35. Inf in
             definition of upper.limit is set to big.
 mnlam       minimum number of path points (lambda values) allowed;
             factory default = 5.
 pmin        minimum null probability for any class. factory default =
             1.0e-5.
 exmx        maximum allowed exponent. factory default = 250.0.
 prec        convergence threshold for multi response bounds adjustment
             solution. factory default = 1.0e-10.
 mxit  	  maximum iterations for multiresponse bounds adjustment
             solution. factory default = 100.
 factory     If true, reset all the parameters to the factory default;
             default is false.

 DETAILS:
    If called with no arguments, glmnetControl() returns a structure with 
    the current settings of these parameters. Any arguments included in the
    fields of the input structure sets those parameters to the new values, 
    and then silently returns. The values set are persistent for the 
    duration of the Matlab session.
