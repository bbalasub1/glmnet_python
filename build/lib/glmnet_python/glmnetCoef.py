 glmnetCoef computes coefficients from a "glmnet" object.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:
    This function extracts coefficients at certain lambdas if they are
    in the lambda sequence of a "glmnet" object or make predictions
    if they are not in that sequence.

 USAGE:
    glmnetCoef(object, s, exact)

    Fewer input arguments (more often) are allowed in the call, but must
    come in the order listed above. To set default values on the way, use
    np.empty([0]). 
    For example, ncoef = glmnetCoef(fit,np.empty([0]),False).

 INPUT ARGUMENTS:
    obj      Fitted "glmnet" model object.
    s        Value(s) of the penalty parameter lambda at which computation
             is required. Default is the entire sequence used to create
             the model.
    exact    If exact = False (default), then the function uses
             linear interpolation to make predictions for values of s
             that do not coincide with those used in the fitting
             algorithm. Note that exact = True is not implemented.

 OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
    result   A (nvars+1) x length(s) np 2D array with each column being the 
             coefficients at an s. Note that the first row are the 
             intercepts (0 if no intercept in the original model).

 EXAMPLES:
    x = np.random.rand(100,20);
    y = np.random.rand(100,1);
    fit = glmnet(x = x.copy(),y = y.copy());
    ncoef = glmnetCoef(fit,np.array([0.01, 0.001]));
