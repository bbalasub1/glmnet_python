 glmnetPrint.m: print a glmnet object
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:
    Print a summary of the glmnet path at each step along the path.

 USAGE: 
    glmnetPrint(fit)

 INPUT ARGUMENTS:
    fit         fitted glmnet object

 DETAILS:
    Three-column matrix with columns Df, %Dev and Lambda is printed. The Df
    column is the number of nonzero coefficients (Df is a reasonable name
    only for lasso fits). %Dev is the percent deviance explained (relative
    to the null deviance).
