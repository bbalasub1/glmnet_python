 cvglmnetCoef computes coefficients from a "cvglmnet" object.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:
    This function extracts coefficients at certain lambdas if they are
    in the lambda sequence of a "cvglmnet" object or make predictions
    if they are not.

 USAGE:
    mcoef=cvglmnetCoef(object);
    ncoef=cvglmnetCoef(object, s);

 INPUT ARGUMENTS:
    obj      Fitted "cvglmnet" model object.
    s        Value(s) of the penalty parameter lambdau at which computation
             is required. Default is the value s='lambda_1se' stored on
             the CV object. Alternatively s='lambda_min' can be used. If s
             is numeric, it is taken as the value(s) of lambda to be used.

 OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
    result   If s is 'lambda_1se' or 'lambda_min', the coefficients at 
             that s is returned. If s is numeric, a (nvars+1) x length(s) 
             matrix is returned with each column being the coefficients 
             at an s. Note that the first row are the intercepts (0 if no 
             intercept in the original model).

 DETAILS:
    The function uses linear interpolation to make predictions for values 
    of s that do not coincide with those used in the fitting algorithm. 
    Exact prediction is not supported currently.
